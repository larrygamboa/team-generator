## User Story
As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.

## Purpose

The purpose of the homework is to build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will run as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about other team members. The user can input any number of team members with a mix of engineers and interns. This application must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will generate an HTML file that displays a formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
